# ExcelProcessor
This is a tool for read and recalculate some columns from an excel file(report.xlsx), and generate a new excel to record the outcome. It might be useful for you if you are not sure how to operate an excel file with C#;

There is a post-build command to merge all the dlls and exe into a single exe program, you need to install ILMerge if you need this, otherwise you can simply remove the post-build event line to compile the solution correctly;

ILMerge can be found @ https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/3/4/1347C99E-9DFB-4252-8F6D-A3129A069F79/ILMerge.msi
